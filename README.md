# ImageAnalysis
Research including image analysis/augmentation using OpenCV.

***TOPICS***
- Exploration of the functionalities of OpenCV
- Analysis on how images are stored and manipulated in code
- Image pre-processing techniques used in OpenCV


These topic are a crucial step in learning to implement these methods and techniques for AI implementation. This is a step toward my image classification project on Retinal OCT image disease classification that will hopefully provide greater insight on the overall process of machine learning. This Repository contains some of the notebooks on OpenCV research and practice that I had performed over the 2024-2025 year. Below I will provide some Snippets of the examples I provide in the notebooks and explain the process.

> Note some of this code may not work locally as the image used are not provided or downloaded within the notebook.
